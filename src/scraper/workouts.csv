Intentionality in projecting. Over the past year I've struggled with consistently focusing on a project. Instead I've been susceptible to going wherever my friends want to climb. 2. Technical climbing and beta reading. I have a tendency to rely on receiving beta from friends since my natural inclination is to thug through climbs as much as possible. Improving my ability to read beta and implement highly technical sequences would definitely help me reach my goals. One specific example of this deficit is that I have hard time on vertical climbs that involve high feet or balancing/perching on my feet. I think this is because I have poor hip mobility and weak legs, especially my right leg.3. Understanding my relative physical strengths and weaknesses. I think that, before this program, I clearly knew that I had a relatively strong back and relatively weak fingers and endurance. Now that we've addressed those weaknesses, it would be helpful to me to have clearer metrics goals so that I can better evaluate how to focus my climbing and training sessions to work weaknesses."

What would you like to spend more time doing?,"I love strength training and I love getting outside and trying hard, so the mix so far has been pretty good for me. I think we're working on the main strength metrics that I'd like to improve most (Max weight pullups and small edge hangs). I'd like to improve my one-arm pull-up strength as well as my one-arm hanging. I think that's my biggest strength related weakness.

22/Mar/2022,Have fun and try hard!,,Tried Wet Dream. Awesome. This is the problem I'm most psyched on in Red Rock. Did all moves up to the first big rail. Could not match it though. Not sure if it would feel better with better conditions or if I just need to be better at climbing. Maybe both.

12/Mar/2022,Goals,"Revisit your goals. What are you proud of that you achieved last cycle? What would you like to achieve this coming cycle (training metrics, climbing sends, mental/emotional barriers)?","I didn't rest today as I have been resting my tweaky back since Tuesday. Instead, I went to Flagstaff and did Reverse UCT, UCT into Bob's Bulge, and Botslayer. UCT and Botslayer I did 3rd and 2nd tries, respectively. I also flashed Battaglia's Bottom.I'm extremely proud of my growth as a climber over this cycle. Before 2021, I had done a total of 5 V10s, and each one was a siege requiring days of effort.  Right before I began this training program, I did my first V10 in one day, Witch Hunt, and I did it on the last go of the session.And as I noted above, today I did 2 V10s in a couple of tries, a V9 and flashed a V7 all in one day - by far the best day of climbing I've ever had. Last week, I did 6 V10s on the Kilter Board, including 4 flashes. Oh, and I did my first V11 in the fall. :D It's clear that the training is paying off. As for goals, I believe that V12 is on the horizon, and I would like to send one before the summer. And as a stretch goal, I think V13 ay be possible before the end of 2022. "

All of the holds were slightly sloping, meaning that locking-off one-handed for big moves was difficult due to the hand slowly slipping. Using momentum on this climb allowed me to use my bodyweight to improve friction on the holds and to swing quickly through them before slipping could occur. This was a fully horizontal line, similar to shitty monkey bars.2nd climb was a V3 jug haul out of a roof. Once again it felt easier moving through dynamically. I think this is because I can capitalize on my momentum and that way flow through  multiple moves in quick succession. That way, I don't get as fatigued as when I'm slowly locking off through the line. "

Missed Steak V8 (Flash)Is Kilter soft or do I need to get outside ASAP?? ðŸ˜‚As for the movement part of this: I chose the above problems specifically because they were highly dynamic. What I noticed from climbing them is that, in nearly every instance, the movement began in my legs. I utilized my arms primarily to keep my body in close to the wall and in that way maximize the amount of useful work I could get out of my legs. I also noticed that modifying the position of my center of mass relative to my hands before a dynamic move had drastic effects. On some moves where I needed max altitude, having my center of mass in line with the axis of movement allowed me to launch farther. On others that weren't as far, having my center of mass off center allowed me to pivot around the static hand and therefore gain more lateral motion. "

When is it easier to twist? Why do yo think that is?-Repeat for 3 more climbs","Twisting pushes the climber's hips away from the wall while bringing your internal shoulder inwards as well. This can be advantageous in a couple situations. One, with the center of mass further from the wall, the climber can create opposition on holds that benefit from pulling away from the wall. This is especially useful for flakey sidepulls. Two, the climber can often gain greater reach by bringing the shoulder inwards and therefore closer to a hold.Keeping the legs square to the wall allows the climber to moderate the center of mass. By pointing toes forward, the climber can push their hips out and move their center of mass outwards. This assists in using terrible smear feet. Alternatively, by pointing the feet in opposite direction the center of mass can be brought close to the wall. This is good using slopers on a vertical wall."

5/Aug/2021,Movement,Knee in or knee out?-Choose a boulder well within your flash limit.-Climb the entire boulder with your knees in (dropknee every move)-Rest to full recovery-Repeat boulder with your knees out-Which moves are easier with your knees in? Knees out? Why do you think that is?-What is your knee positioning doing to your ankles? Hips?,"Drop-knees create an extremely stable base given the right setup. This is due to the climber being able to create strong oppositional forces between two footholds. This means that, for a knee-in position to be truly effective, the footholds need to be far enough apart that the climber is able to exert primarily horizontal force on both holds simultaneously. Typically drop-knees are more effective for short moves as well, as to take full advantage of the stability of the drop-knee, most motion should be generated above the hips.Knee-out positions allows the climber to high-step, keep their center-of-mass close to the wall, and leverage explosive motion generated from the large muscles of the legs. This means that knee-out positions are generally more versatile. I would typically use knee-out positions for most moves, and knee-in in the niche circumstances described above."

I chose the two of you because you are both bigger and more muscular than typical climbers. This better matches my personal body composition.The first thing I tried to emulate was maintaining tension throughout the entire body. I noticed that great climbers tend to maintain tension through the legs and core much better than I do. I find that, if I feel I'm on good handholds, I'll loosen up in the legs and core which leads to unnecessary motion and therefore slipping. The second was intentionality. I noticed that great climbers are really efficient in moving between optimal body positions. I noticed this especially during dynamic movements. Cutting feet can be inefficient if done unintentionally, but in some circumstances, center-of-mass can be manipulated in a way that can make catching a hold during a dyno or "

20/Jul/2021,Movement: Toes,"During your climbing session, pay specific attention to your ""toe dig"", the pressure you're putting on your toes in an overhang. How much pressure is enough? Too much? How does twisting your ankle affect your knee position? Hip position?","Climbed for roughly an hour. Worked V7 and V8 for 5 reps, and sent a V9 in 3 tries.I think these are rhetorical questions, but I'm going to answer them anyway: It seems like I need to focus on more toe dig pressure in nearly every case. I naturally over-focus on my arms which sometimes causes me to cut feet due to low pressure toe dig. In some instances, too much toe pressure lifts the center of mass and thus causes inefficient grip positions. I don't think I do this often, but will be more attentive moving forward.Rotating the ankle to the left causes knee to go to the right and hip to go left. "
